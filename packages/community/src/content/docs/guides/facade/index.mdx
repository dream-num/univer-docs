The plugin capabilities of Univer are very powerful, allowing you to extend almost every aspect of Univer. However, in most cases, the overly flexible extension capabilities can make developers feel overwhelmed. Therefore, we provide `@univerjs/facade`, a simpler and easier-to-use panel API (Facade API) for Univer users.

`@univerjs/facade` is suitable for everyone, especially for those who are familiar with Luckysheet's old users, or just want to use Univer's functions simply without intending to deeply extend users. With `@univerjs/facade`, you can quickly get started and easily implement various common CRUD functions.

This document will detail how to use the API provided by `@univerjs/facade` to help you fully unleash the potential of Univer. If you want to see all the Facade APIs, please refer to the [API documentation](/api/facade) of `@univerjs/facade`. By learning and using these APIs, you will be able to develop powerful office applications more efficiently and conveniently.

:::note
In fact, [Uniscript](/api/uniscript) also uses `@univerjs/facade`, so you can directly use the API provided by `@univerjs/facade` in the Uniscript panel created by `@univerjs/uniscript`.

## Installation

Install via your favorite package manager:

```shell
# Using npm
npm install @univerjs/facade

# Using pnpm
pnpm add @univerjs/facade
```

## Usage

The API provided by `@univerjs/facade` is a wrapper around the `Univer` instance. Therefore, after creating a `Univer` instance, you need to wrap it with `FUniver`:

```typescript title="main.ts"
import { FUniver } from "@univerjs/facade";

const univerAPI = FUniver.newAPI(univer);
```

You can then use the Univer functionality by calling methods on the `univerAPI` object. For example, get the currently activated Workbook:

```typescript title="main.ts"
univerAPI.getActiveWorkbook();
```

You can refer to the [Facade API documentation](/api/facade/) for a more detailed description of what you can achieve with Facade. In the following sections, we will demonstrate some common usage scenarios.
