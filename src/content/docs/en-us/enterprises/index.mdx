We provide out-of-the-box services for users with collaboration needs such as **collaborative office** and **Live Share**.

### Collaborative Office

Edit the same document with your colleagues and see each other's edits in real time. We also provide storage and loading services for Univer documents, and will support features such as version history in the future.

### Live Share

During collaborative office work with your colleagues, you can give presentations. Your colleagues can follow your perspective in real time, and can pause or resume following at any time.
