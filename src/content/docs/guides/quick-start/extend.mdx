title: Extend Univer
---

Univer's built-in functionalities may not meet your specific needs, but you can extend Univer to implement your business logic. You can extend Univer in the following areas:

* [Command System](/guides/extend/command): This includes custom commands, supplementing mutations with other commands, and extending features like copy-paste and fill-down.
* [Formula System](/guides/plugins/sheets/sheets-formula): This involves implementing custom formulas.
* [UI](/guides/extend/ui): This includes custom menus, toolbars, dialogues, and more.

We recommend encapsulating your extensions to Univer, along with your business code, within a Univer plugin.

You can learn how to write a custom plugin [here](/guides/extend/write-a-plugin).
