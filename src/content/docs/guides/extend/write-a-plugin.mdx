We provide a command line tool [`@univerjs/create-cli`](https://github.com/dream-num/cli) for users who want to extend the functionality of Univer. You can refer to the following instructions to use it.

## Create a project

import { Tabs, TabItem } from "@astrojs/starlight/components";

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="npm">
    ```shell
      npm create @univerjs/cli@latest
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="pnpm">
    ```shell
      pnpm create @univerjs/cli@latest
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>
