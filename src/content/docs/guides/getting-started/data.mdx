In the previous section's code, you have already created a Univer instance and an empty spreadsheet. However, in most cases, you will likely need to load existing data into Univer. This section will explain how to load data into Univer and retrieve data from it.

## Loading Data

By calling the `createUniverSheet` method of `Univer`, you can create a new `Workbook` instance. The method's first parameter is an object that contains the data for the `Workbook`, which should adhere to the `IWorkbookData` interface.

```typescript
import { IWorkbookData } from "@univerjs/core";

// ... create univer instance and load plugins

const data: IWorkbookData = {};
const workbook = univer.createUniverSheet(data);
```

You can find the complete list of supported fields for `IWorkbookData` [here](/api/core/interfaces/IWorkbookData.html).

## Storing Data

By calling the `save` method of the `Workbook`, you can obtain an `IWorkbookData` object that contains the data within the spreadsheet.

```typescript
const savedData = workbook.save();
```
