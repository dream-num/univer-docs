`@univerjs/uniscript` uses the DSL (Domain-Specific Language) provided by `@univerjs/facade` and creates a code editor for Users to write code for operating Univer's data structures and business logic.


<Image src={UniscriptImg} alt="Uniscript" />

Users can write business logic in the code editor to meet more flexible business requirements. For instance, as shown in the illustration, users can write a Uniscript to read identity card numbers from a selected area and validate their legality, and mark the background of invalid identity card numbers with red.

:::caution[Experimental]
The Uniscript is currently in the experimental stage, and it is not recommended to use it in production environments. You can refer to the [Roadmap](/en-us/guides/roadmap) to understand the iteration plan of Uniscript.

## Get the Editor Instance

The `@univerjs/uniscript` uses [Monaco Editor](https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/) as its code editor. You can obtain an instance of the editor through the following method:

```ts
const editor = univer.__getInjector().get(ScriptEditorService).getEditorInstance();
```

Or inject `ScriptEditorService` into your module to obtain the editor instance.

```ts
export class YourModule {
  constructor(
    @Inject(ScriptEditorService) private readonly _scriptEditorService
  ) {}

  private _getEditor() {
    return this._scriptEditorService.getEditorInstance();
  }
}
```
