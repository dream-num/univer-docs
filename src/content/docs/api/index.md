The architecture of Univer divides all its features into plugins. Plugins are pluggable modules that can be registered and used in Univer instances.

This page will provide documentation for all official plugins and their output of each function, hook, component, and type. If you are looking for guides and tutorials, please refer to our [Guides](/docs/guides/introduction).
